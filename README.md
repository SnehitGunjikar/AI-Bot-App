## About  
AI-Bot-App allows a user to have conversational interactions with an AI model through a clean, minimal React-based interface. The project is designed as a lightweight, easy-to-deploy chatbot web app.  

This repository hosts the front-end code (built in React), which interacts with a backend (or AI API) to fetch responses and handle the chat logic.  

## Features  
- Real-time chat UI for sending user messages and receiving AI responses  
- Clean, responsive interface — works well on desktops and mobile devices  
- Message history displayed in a chat layout  
- Deployment ready — live version hosted on Vercel  

## Tech Stack  
- **React** — for building UI components and the main application structure  
- **JavaScript / JSX** — primary coding language  
- **HTML / CSS** — for layout and styling  
- (Optionally) any AI-back-end or API integration for generating intelligent responses  

> *If you integrate with an AI backend (e.g. OpenAI or similar), you might need environment variables (e.g. API keys) — see backend instructions or your preferred backend setup.*
